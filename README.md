# Northwind_Traders
Analysis of Northwind traders dataset to see how sales can be improved.

## Introduction
In this project, I apply the Power BI skills I have learnt over the past week, by documenting my analysis of Northwind Traders dataset that the organization I am learning from has provided. This project aims to assess how well the company is doing in terms of the services provided to its customers and to gain insights into how the customers perceive the business.

## Problem Statement
Northwind Traders, a company known for distributing gourmet food products, wants to make its operations better and decisions smarter in the 2nd half of 2015. To achieve this, the company plans to study its sales data, how customers behave, and how well its products are doing with emphasis on the 1st half of 2015. By doing this, Northwind Traders hopes to find important insights and ways to grow even more.
In their analysis, Northwind Traders wants to look closely at sales trends, how customers buy things, and which products are selling well based on what was achieved in the 1st half of 2015. They believe that by understanding these things better, they can make smarter choices about what to sell and how to sell it. This means they can make sure they have the right products in stock and keep their customers happy.
